Homework05 folder for STAT 545.

See the  file [HW05_factor_figure_management.md](https://github.com/sepkamal/STAT545-hw-Kamal-Sepehr/blob/master/Hw05/HW05_factor_figure_management.md) for my assignment.

# Reflection

I found [this page](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html) from class quite helpful for this assignment.

I had never written a function in R before, but after a bit of time on Google I manged to figure it out. At first I tried to save the graph as an object, but that didn't work (don't think it's possible to do this). Then I thought a function might work. It was super helpful because I didn't want to copy and paste a massive block of code over and over. I found [this page](https://www.statmethods.net/management/userfunctions.html) helpful for how to write a function. 

I was also very confused when playing around with arrange(). I thought I was doing something wrong, but it turned out it was working properly from the beginning. It's just that arrange() does not directly effect the display order for items in a plot. I was able to understand this by examining the effect of arrange() on a data table and also when piping into head().

Also kids, don't finish your stats homework mere minutes before it's due. I almost crashed R and deleted the Rproject file, freaked out, but just managed to fix it in time... :thumbsup:

Overall this assignment took me a very long time, but I learned lots of things in the process!
