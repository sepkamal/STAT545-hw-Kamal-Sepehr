The overall aim of this assignment is to **look for trends in the gapminder data using body mass index as a measure of obesity**. I thought this would be an interesting idea as I work in a diabetes research lab. I was originally going to use diabetes rates as I did in [homework04](https://github.com/sepkamal/STAT545-hw-Kamal-Sepehr/blob/master/Hw04/hw04-tidaydata.md), but then I found a nice BMI dataset on the [gapminder website](http://www.gapminder.org/data/), which references the MRC-HPA Centre for Environment and Health.

The BMI data is provided as a google sheet, so downloading it was a bit tricky. Luckily there is a package `gsheet` which helps download google sheets in R. The BMI data was provided seperately for males and females, so I downloaded both files.

```{r}

There was not enough data for Oceania, so I removed it from the analysis.
