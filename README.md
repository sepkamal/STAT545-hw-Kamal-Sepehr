## Welcome to me

My name is Sep, I did my undergrad in biology at UBC and am now doing my masters in genome science and technology, working in a diabetes lab at the life sciences institute.

I am also an arsenal fan! ~~Though sometimes they drive me crazy~~

## So...R Stats, Eh?

A few years ago I started working on this project to analyze some DNA sequencing data. I was using excel.

**It was hell.**

### Excel Strugles
+ Graphs were terrible.
    + Poor formatting.
    + Couldn't display the data the way I wanted.
+ It was easy to accidentaly introduce errors to single data points.
+ With big data sets excel would get laggy and even crash.

So... That's why I'm hoping R can save me.


## Progress Report

This README.md file was edited in RStudio after initially creating this file and repository on github. I made edits, saved, commited, and then pulled and pushed to github. I had some trouble with syntax for things like links and pictures, but after some trial and error got it working. I kept finding typos so had to keep commiting over and over.

I found this site to be really helpful while putting this together: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
