## So... R Stats, Eh?

A few years ago I started working on this project to analyze some DNA sequencing data. I was using excel. **It was hell.**

### Excel Strugles
+ Graphs were terrible.
    + Poor formatting
    + Couldn't display the data the way I wanted
+ It was easy to accidentaly introduce errors to single data points.
+ With big data sets excel would get laggy and even crash.




# Progress Report

This README.md file was edited in RStudio after initially creating this file and repository on github.
